Seriously, the story of FFXIII makes no sense


So my name is David, and I've been a software engineer for 7 years or so. During that time I've worked on html/css, javascript frontends, legacy systems that handle large amounts of traffic, and new systems that also handle large amounts of traffic.

Currently I'm a Senior Software Engineer at SendGrid where I work on the labs projects. Most recently I worked on threads.io, which was a triggered engagement platform for email, webhooks, and sms. The "Senior" part means I've been around longer than to know better, and "Software Engineer" part is the nicest way to say I stare at a monitor for 6-12 hours a day of my own volition.

I also play video games, as time permits. I tend to skew towards RPGS, but in all honestly I'll play anything that I find fun. I play games in-between working on side projects (mostly web and game based) and lifting weights (because sitting around all day isn't doing me any favors). After all of that is taken care of I occasionally sleep, but it's a habit I'm trying to break.
