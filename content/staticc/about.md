Yo, my name is David and I go by viking at work. Why? David is a fairly common name, so of course we have 5 Davids where I work. I happened to be the one with a large beard and a tendency to pick things up, so boom, viking became my HipChat handle and it's kind of stuck ever since.

Looking for a more profession view of who I am? Check out my resume [coming soon].

### What makes a viking tick
I have 3 major hobbies I try my best to entertain. It's not always easy as life and work love to get in the way, but what you do in your free time molds and shapes you in ways you won't always understand at first.

#### Lifting
Firstly I've been an avid lifter for the last 4 years or so. By "lifter" I mean both power-lifting (Benchpress, Deadlift, Back squat), Olympic lifting (Clean and Jerk, Snatch), and all the other in between and accessory lifts you do to get stronger. Current Powerlifting total is 1375#, which I'm quite happy about. That's a 500# Squat, 305# Bench, and a 570# Deadlift. I lift because otherwise I would be inside way too much and, turns out, lifting is both fun and great stress relief.

#### Code Projects
Secondly I code. I know, it's what I do for my job so it seems odd to have it as a "hobby", but it is. While at work I have to worry about product decisions, scalability, maintainability, and solving problems for email and it's related areas at home I can code on whatever the fuck I want in whatever language I want for however long I want. This is important as it keeps coding both fun and keeps me learning. I have a large interest in game dev, so I tend to work on small games and play with new tech often. I haven't done a great job at finishing a game project yet, but it'll happen.

#### Video Games
Lastly I play games. This has been the oldest hobby for mine by a long run, tracking back to the NES in 1990. It also is the hobby that gets the least amount of time, or it's the hobby I feel the most comfortable ditching if time gets tight.

That said, I do occasionally hunker down and spend insane amounts of time playing. For the last few years (well since 2009) I've been huge fan of the 'Souls' series. From Software went from a company I loved because of armored core to one I loved because they create the best Action RPG ever. (I mean, it's pretty much spawned it's own sub-genre at this point). I mostly play RPGs, but will play anything that's fun.

During the day I work as a Software Engineer for SendGrid. Currently I work on the labs teams and in any given week will write code in Python, Ruby, Go, and Javascript. If I have to work on the main core product then I also get to mess with Perl, which means first reviewing the operators again because apparently Perl decided every fucking symbol should be used at least twice in their syntax.
